File
````

* **New**: create a new project.
* **Open...**: show a file dialog to open a project.
* **Examples**: contains all stored examples depending on the selected board.
* **Add as block...**: add a project as a block.
* **Save**: save the current project.
* **Save as...**: show a save file dialog to save the current project.
* **Export...**: show a save file dialog to export

  * **Verilog**: the current verilog code file (.v).
  * **PCF**: the current pcf file (.pcf).
  * **Testbench**: an auto-generated testbench (.v).
  * **GTKWave**: a GTKWave file with all signals showed (.gtkw).

* **Quit**: exit the application

.. note::

  When a project is added as a block, all FPGA information is removed before being stored.


.. hint::

  Examples are stored in `app/resources/examples`. To create a new examples category just create a directory there. To create a new example copy and paste an **.ice** file.

Edit
````

* **Reset view**: reset pan and zoom to its default values.
* **Clone selected**: clone the selected block. It can also be done with *Ctrl + c* key.
* **Remove selected**: remove the selected block. It can also be done with *Ctrl + x* and *Supr* keys.
* **Clear all**: remove all blocks and wires from the graph.
* **Preferences**:

  * **Project information**: show a menu to edit the information of the project.
  * **Remote hostname**: set the hostame of a remote device with a FPGA board connected. The format is user@host. For example, pi@192.168.0.22. Verify, Build and Upload functions will be executed in this host, that must have apio pre-configured.
  * **Language**: select the application language: English, Spanish, Galician, Basque and French. This selection is stored in the app profile.

.. note::

  The Project information contains the name, version, description, author and image of the project.

View
````

* **PCF**: show the selected board PCF file in a new window.
* **Pinout**: show the selected board SVG pinout in a new window.
* **Datasheet**: open a web browser with the information of the selected board.

Boards
``````
It contains the supported boards: **IceZUM Alhambra**, **Go board**, **iCEstick**, **iCE40-HX8K**, **icoBOARD 1.0**, **KÃ©fir I**. When a board is selected all I/O block combos are updated and its current values removed.

.. hint::

  This information is stored in the `app/resources/boards` directory. To support a new board just create a new directory with the *info.json*, *pinout.pcf* and *pinout.svg* (optional) files with its information. Also, a generator.py script has been created to generate the *pinout.json* file from the *pinout.pcf*.

Tools
`````

* **Verify**: check the generated verilog source code.
* **Build**: generate the bitstream from the graphic source.
* **Upload**: generate and upload the bitstream to the FPGA board.
* **Toolchain**:

  * **Install/Update**: install a python virtualenv in `.icestudio/venv`, apio and its packages in `.icestudio/apio`. It requires Python 2.7.
  * **Remove**: remove the `.icestudio` directory.
  * **Reset default**: restore the default toolchain distributed with Icestudio.
  * **Apio version**: show the current apio version.

* **Drivers**:

  * **Enable**: launch the FTDI drivers configuration. Each OS has a different process.
  * **Disable**: revert the FTDI drivers configuration. Each OS has a different process.

.. hint::

  Generated files are stored in the `_build` directory.

Help
````

* **View license**: open the Icestudio's license in a web browser.
* **Version**: show the current version.
* **Documentation**: open the Icestudio's documentation in a web browser.
* **Source code**: open the Icestudio's source code in a web browser.
* **Community forum**: open the FPGAwars forum in a web browser.
* **About Icestudio**: information about the application.

Blocks menu
-----------

Basic
`````

It contains the basic blocks:

* **Input**: show a dialog to insert the name and type of the input block.
* **Output**: show a dialog to insert the name and type of the output block.
* **Constant**: show a dialog to insert the name and type of the constant block.
* **Code**: show a dialog to insert the ports and parameters of the code block.
* **Info**: create an empty text box block.

.. note::

  **Input** and **output** ports can be set to **virtual**. Virtual ports allow to easily visualize independent-FPGA projects.
  Also, they can be configured as a **bus** by adding the notation ``[x:y]`` to the port name.

.. note::

  **Constant** blocks can be set to **local**. Local parameters are not exposed when the project is added as a block.

.. hint::

  Multiple **input**, **output** and **constant** blocks can be created using the `comma` separator. For example: ``x, y, z`` will create 3 blocks with those names. FPGA I/O ports values are set in the block combo box. These values can be set by searching and also unset by doing click on the cross.
  Double click over **input**, **output** or **constant** block allows to modify the block name and type.
  In **code** block ports definition, multiple *input* and *output* ports, and *parameters*, can be created also using the `comma` separator.

Stored blocks
`````````````

It contains all stored blocks sorted by categories. These menu is generated when the application starts.

.. hint::

  Blocks are stored in `app/resources/blocks`. To create a new block category just create a directory there. To create a new block copy and paste an **.ice** file.


Graph
-----

This is the main panel. It contains the blocks and the wires.

Pan & Zoom
``````````

Pan is performed using the **mouse left button** over the background. Zoom is performed using **mouse wheel**. Both values can be reset in *View > Reset view*.

.. image:: ../resources/images/gui/pan-zoom.png


Select
``````

Block selection is performed using the **mouse right button**. Blocks can be selected/unselected individually using right-click/Ctrl+right-click, respectively. In addition, several blocks can be selected by a selection box. Selection is cancelled when the background is clicked.

Blocks examination
``````````````````

Non-basic blocks can be read only examined by **double clicking** the block using the **mouse left button**. This is a recursive action. In order to go back, click on **< back** link.

During the examination, pan, zoom and code navigation are enabled.

.. note::

  The examination path is stored in the **breadcrumbs**. This allows you to go back to any previous block.

Take a snapshot
```````````````

Taking a **png** snapshot of the application is as easy as press `Ctrl+p`. A save dialog appears to set the name and the path of the captured image.
